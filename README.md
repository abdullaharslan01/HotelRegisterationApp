# Hotel Reservation App
"This project is an iOS application that allows hotel employees to manage customer records. The app enables users to enter customer information, select room types, set check-in and check-out dates, and adjust other accommodation preferences. Additionally, users can save and update this information. Throughout this project, I learned about delegate design patterns and unwind segues."
